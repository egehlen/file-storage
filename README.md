# File Storage

**Work in progress** - Self-guided study. A full-stack file storage application (e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox). Back-end is a Node/Typescript application that consists of a WebApi built upon NestJs, authorization through JWT token, files and users metadata stored in a Postgresql database using Prisma as ORM, and files content stored in AWS S3, unit tests done with Jest (for some areas). Front-end is a React/Typescript application that was built with Vite, using AntDesign as UI components.
